Hey, I'm James

I'm a student at Utah State University studying Information Systems with an emphasis in CyberSecurity. This blog is where I share write-ups from the [KC7](https://kc7.com) platform, walkthroughs of labs and CTFs, and the occasional learning note.

I created **The Peach** as a side project to document my progress, build a portfolio of my problem-solving, and hopefully help others who are learning too.

This is my first time building a blog so I will be updating it more as time goes on, but for now I just wanted to build something that I can post on.
