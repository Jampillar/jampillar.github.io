[KC7](https://kc7cyber.com)is a hands-on cybersecurity training platform built by CyberDefenders. It simulates real-world environments, where you investigate incidents, analyze logs, and hunt for threats — just like a real SOC analyst would.

This page collects my write-ups and walkthroughs for each KC7 challenge I complete. These aren’t just answers — they’re step-by-step breakdowns of my thinking, tools used, and lessons learned.
